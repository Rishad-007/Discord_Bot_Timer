## üîê Important Security Note

Never share your bot token publicly. If it's exposed, regenerate it immediately from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

To keep your token secure, you can store it in a `.env` file:

### Using `.env` for Security

1. Install `python-dotenv`:
     ```bash
     pip install python-dotenv
     ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the same folder:

     ```
     DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_actual_token_here
     ```

3. Update your Python code to load the token from `.env`:

     ```python
     from dotenv import load_dotenv
     import os

     load_dotenv()
     TOKEN = os.getenv("DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN")
     bot.run(TOKEN)
     ```
